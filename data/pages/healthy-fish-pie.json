    "Preheat the oven to gas 6, 200°C, fan 180°C. Pour the milk into a large saucepan, add the bay leaves and spring onion and bring to a simmer. Mix the cornflour and 3 tablespoons cold water to form a paste, then stir into the milk and simmer for 3-4 minutes or until thickened slightly. Season well, add the mustard and dill and cook for another 2 minutes. Remove the bay leaves and discard. Stir in the fish mix, prawns and peas and pour into a 1.5-litre (2 1/2 pint) ovenproof dish.",
    "Place the whole peeled potatoes into a large pan of boiling salted water and blanch for 1 minute. Remove from the pan, cool slightly, grate into a large clean tea towel and squeeze gently to remove excess liquid. Tip the potato into a bowl, add the olive oil and Cheddar cheese and season well. Then scatter over the fish.",
    "Place in the preheated oven and bake for 30 minutes or until bubbling hot and golden on top. Serve with steamed green vegetables."
