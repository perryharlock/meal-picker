Heat an ovenproof frying pan on the hob until just hot, then add the oil, onion and red pepper and fry for 2 minutes, until just softened. .","Turn the heat up, add the chorizo and cook for 3-4 minutes until it has released its oil and is crisp around the edges. The mixture will go a lovely red colour.","Meanwhile, crack the eggs into a large jug and whisk with the milk, a pinch of salt and plenty of black pepper.","Add the garlic and potatoes to the chorizo mixture and fry for another 2 minutes, stirring gently, until just hot through. Add the peas and cook for another minute, until the whole mixture is hot.","Pour in the egg, stir briefly, turn down to a medium heat and scatter the parsley over the top..","Fry without stirring, for 1-2 minutes, then carefully lift the edge of the frittata with a spatula to check if it is cooked and golden-brown underneath. If it isn't, cook for another minute then check again.","Place the pan in the oven and bake for 10-12 minutes. When the top is bubbled up and slightly golden use a tea towel to grab the handle and give the pan a gentle shake. If the middle wobbles it needs a little longer. If it's fairly firm, put it aside to cool slightly.","Slide the frittata out of the pan onto a plate. You can serve this hot or cold but make sure to let it cool to room temperature before storing it in a sealable container in the fridge. Cut it into slices and serve with a green salad."]},"__N_SSG":true}
